## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a basic authentication system for educational purposes.

For production use, consider:
- Password hashing (bcrypt, etc.)
- Email verification
- Password reset functionality
- Rate limiting for login attempts
- HTTPS enforcement
- More robust session management

## Usage

1. **New Users**: Click "Create Account" → Fill form → Auto-login
2. **Returning Users**: Enter username/password → Click "Sign In"
3. **Logout**: Click "Logout" button in header
4. **Session**: Users stay logged in until they logout or clear browser data

The system now provides a complete user experience where students and teachers can create accounts, return to their conversations, and maintain their identity across sessions!
